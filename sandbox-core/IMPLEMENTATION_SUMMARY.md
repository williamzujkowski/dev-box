## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design

- **Clean Separation**: Lifecycle, monitoring, and safety concerns are cleanly
  separated
- **Async/Await**: Fully asynchronous operations for better performance
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase
- **Extensible**: Plugin-friendly architecture for custom implementations

### Safety-First Approach

- **Pre-execution Validation**: All operations validated before execution
- **Configurable Rules**: Flexible safety rules and constraints
- **Risk Assessment**: Multi-level risk scoring for operations
- **Rollback Capability**: Point-in-time recovery mechanisms

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Real-time Tracking**: Resource usage and operation monitoring
- **Health Assessment**: Continuous system health evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive analytics and reporting
- **Event System**: Extensible notification and alerting

### State Management

- **Versioned State**: Full state history with rollback support
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite-based storage with encryption
- **Snapshots**: Point-in-time state capture and restoration
- **Integrity Checks**: Corruption detection and validation

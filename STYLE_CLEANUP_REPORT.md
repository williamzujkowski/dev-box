## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Tool Configuration**

**Python Tools (pyproject.toml):**

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py39']

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
select = ["E4", "E7", "E9", "F", "W", "I", "N", "UP", "B", "A", "C4"]
ignore = ["E501", "E203"]
```

**JavaScript Tools (.prettierrc):**

```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "singleQuote": false,
  "printWidth": 88,
  "tabWidth": 2
}
```

**ESLint Configuration:**

- Comprehensive rule set covering best practices
- Integration with Prettier to avoid conflicts
- Modern JavaScript/ES2021 standards
- Custom overrides for configuration files

### **Pre-commit Integration**

**Automated Checks:**

- Python: Black, Ruff (check + format)
- JavaScript: Prettier, ESLint
- Shell: ShellCheck, basic formatting
- General: YAML/JSON validation, line ending fixes

**Installation & Usage:**

```bash
# One-time setup
pre-commit install

# Manual execution
pre-commit run --all-files

# Development workflow
npm run format    # Format all files
npm run lint      # Run all linters
npm run style:check  # Verify formatting
```

## 🎯 Code Quality Improvements

### **Consistency Gains**

**Before Implementation:**

- Mixed indentation styles (tabs vs spaces)
- Inconsistent line lengths (80-120+ characters)
- Various quote styles and formatting approaches
- No automated enforcement

**After Implementation:**

- ✅ Uniform 88-character line length across all languages
- ✅ Consistent 2-space (JS) and 4-space (Python) indentation
- ✅ Standardized quote usage and punctuation
- ✅ Automated enforcement preventing regression

### **Maintainability Improvements**

**Developer Experience:**

- ✅ **Automated formatting** - No manual style decisions needed
- ✅ **IDE integration** - All tools work with popular editors

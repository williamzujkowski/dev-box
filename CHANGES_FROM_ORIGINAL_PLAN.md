# Changes From Original Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** Planning Phase Complete

This document tracks all significant changes from the original project plan, including design decisions, architectural changes, and scope modifications.

---

## Major Design Changes

### 1. Network Mode Default: ISOLATED → NAT_FILTERED

**Status:** ✅ Approved and Documented
**Impact:** High (affects default security posture)
**Phase:** Planning (before implementation)

#### Original Plan
- **Default Network Mode:** `NetworkMode.ISOLATED`
- **Rationale:** Maximum security - no network access by default
- **Use Case:** Assumed agents could function without internet

#### Current Plan
- **Default Network Mode:** `NetworkMode.NAT_FILTERED`
- **Rationale:** CLI agents require internet to function effectively
- **Use Case:** Real-world agent usage (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

#### Why Changed?

**Primary Reason:** CLI coding agents fundamentally require internet access to be useful:

1. **API Calls:** Agents call LLM APIs, search APIs, package registry APIs
2. **Package Management:** `apt install`, `pip install`, `npm install` all need internet
3. **Git Operations:** Clone, push, pull require network access
4. **Documentation:** Fetching docs, examples, Stack Overflow
5. **Dependency Resolution:** Most package managers need to resolve dependencies online

**Without internet access, agents cannot:**
- Install tools or libraries
- Fetch code examples
- Access documentation
- Use git repositories
- Make API calls

This makes an isolated-by-default environment **impractical for the primary use case**.

#### Security Maintained How?

Despite network access, security is maintained through **6 defense layers**:

1. **KVM Hardware Isolation (Layer 0):**
   - Cannot escape VM regardless of network access
   - CPU-enforced memory boundaries
   - Separate address space

2. **Network Filtering (Layer 1):**
   - **Whitelist approach:** Only necessary ports allowed
   - **Allowed:** DNS (UDP 53), HTTP (TCP 80), HTTPS (TCP 443), SSH (TCP 22), Git (TCP 9418)
   - **Blocked:** All unsolicited incoming (NEW state)
   - **Blocked:** All other outgoing ports

3. **seccomp (Layer 2):**
   - Syscall filtering
   - Blocks dangerous system calls

4. **Linux Namespaces (Layer 3):**
   - PID, network, mount, IPC isolation
   - Process tree isolation

5. **cgroups (Layer 4):**
   - CPU, memory, disk, network quotas
   - Prevents resource exhaustion

6. **Monitoring & Anomaly Detection (Layer 5):**
   - All network connections logged
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Anomaly alerts
   - Auto-response to suspicious activity

#### When to Use ISOLATED Mode?

Use `NetworkMode.ISOLATED` explicitly when:
- Testing truly untrusted code
- Testing malware samples
- Maximum paranoia required
- No external dependencies needed

**Example:**
```python
template = VMTemplate(
    name="untrusted-vm",
    network_mode=NetworkMode.ISOLATED  # Explicit override
)
```

#### Documentation Updated

- ✅ `NETWORK_CONFIG_GUIDE.md` - Network setup instructions
- ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture diagrams updated
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant guidance updated
- ✅ `TDD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Test examples updated
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Implementation updated
- ✅ `src/agent_vm/README.md` - API docs and examples updated

#### Impact Assessment

| Area | Impact | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Security | Medium (mitigated by 6 defense layers) | ✅ Documented |
| Usability | High (agents now functional by default) | ✅ Improved |
| Performance | Low (network adds minimal overhead) | ✅ Acceptable |
| Testing | Medium (need network filtering tests) | ✅ Tests planned |
| Documentation | High (extensive updates needed) | ✅ Complete |

---

## Minor Changes

### 2. Documentation Structure Reorganization

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Impact:** Low (organizational only)
**Phase:** Planning

#### Change
Created a master documentation index (`README_PROJECT_PLANS.md`) to help navigate the extensive documentation.

#### Reason
With 6000+ lines of documentation across 9+ files, users needed a clear entry point and reading order.

#### Files Added
- `README_PROJECT_PLANS.md` - Master overview and reading guide

---

### 3. Enhanced AI Assistant Guidance

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Impact:** Medium (helps AI assistants implement correctly)
**Phase:** Planning

#### Change
Expanded `CLAUDE.md` from basic guidelines to comprehensive 800+ line guide for AI assistants.

#### Reason
AI assistants (like Claude Code) will be primary developers, so comprehensive guidance helps them:
- Follow TDD approach
- Use correct patterns
- Meet quality standards
- Understand architectural decisions

#### Additions
- Detailed TDD workflow examples
- Code patterns and conventions
- Common usage patterns
- Troubleshooting guide
- Quick reference sections

---

### 4. Component README Created Early

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Impact:** Low (documentation timing)
**Phase:** Planning (Day 13-14 task done early)

#### Change
Created `src/agent_vm/README.md` during planning phase instead of waiting until Day 13-14.

#### Reason
Having API documentation and usage examples early:
- Helps implementers understand target API
- Provides reference during implementation
- Clarifies design decisions
- Acts as specification

#### Content
- 1200+ lines of API documentation
- 5 complete usage examples
- Component descriptions
- Testing instructions
- Development workflow

---

- Advanced scheduling algorithms
- ML-based anomaly detection

These are deferred to post-v1.0 releases.

## Impact on Implementation

### What Stays the Same
✅ **TDD Approach:** Still required, all tests defined
✅ **Component Design:** All components unchanged
✅ **Quality Standards:** Same requirements (80% coverage, mypy strict, etc.)
✅ **Timeline:** 8 weeks, 56 days
✅ **Technology Stack:** No changes

### What Changed
⚠️ **Default Network Mode:** NAT_FILTERED instead of ISOLATED
⚠️ **Network Tests:** Must test filtering rules
⚠️ **Documentation:** More extensive (6000+ lines)

### Implementation Impact: Minimal

The network mode change affects **only** template generation (`template.py`):

```python
# Original (planned):
class NetworkMode(Enum):
    ISOLATED = "isolated"  # Default
    NAT = "nat"
    BRIDGE = "bridge"

# Current (actual):
class NetworkMode(Enum):
    NAT_FILTERED = "nat_filtered"  # Default (changed)
    ISOLATED = "isolated"
    BRIDGE = "bridge"
```

**Tests to add:**
- Test network filter is applied in NAT_FILTERED mode
- Test no network interface in ISOLATED mode
- Integration test: Verify allowed/blocked connections

**Estimated additional work:** 2-3 hours (already included in Day 4-5 estimates)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
✅ **Thorough Planning:** Caught major design issue before implementation
✅ **Documentation First:** Revealed usability problems early
✅ **Use Case Analysis:** Tested assumptions against real-world needs
✅ **TDD Approach:** Tests defined early show what's actually needed

### What to Watch
⚠️ **Network Complexity:** Filtering rules may be tricky to get right
⚠️ **Testing Network:** Need real VMs to test network filtering
⚠️ **Documentation Volume:** 6000+ lines is a lot to maintain

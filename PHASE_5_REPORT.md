## Test Implementation Summary

### Integration Tests (tests/integration/test_communication.py)

**Status:** 14 passing, 4 failing, 8 skipped (26 total)
**Coverage:** Communication layer integration with real libvirt

**Passing Tests (14):**
- ✅ FilesystemShare import and instantiation
- ✅ VsockProtocol import and instantiation
- ✅ Guest agent file existence and syntax validation
- ✅ Environment readiness checks (libvirt, workspace fixtures)
- ✅ Async integration test capability validation

**Failing Tests (4):**
- ❌ `test_filesystem_inject_code` - AsyncMock issue with `write_file()`
- ❌ `test_filesystem_extract_results` - AsyncMock issue with `read_file()`
- ❌ `test_filesystem_cleanup` - Async cleanup method mocking
- ❌ `test_filesystem_error_handling` - Exception propagation in async context

**Skipped Tests (8):**
- ⏭️ Tests requiring real VMs (E2E scope, not integration)
- ⏭️ Tests requiring guest agent deployment
- ⏭️ Full communication flow tests (deferred to E2E)

**Root Cause:** FilesystemShare API uses async methods (`write_file`, `read_file`, `cleanup`), but test fixtures don't properly mock the async context. Tests need updated mock setup with `AsyncMock` for all I/O operations.

### E2E Tests (tests/e2e/test_workflows.py)

**Status:** 6 passing, 7 failing (13 total)
**Coverage:** Complete workflows using real (or minimally mocked) components
**File Size:** 1,073 lines of comprehensive workflow validation

**Passing Tests (6):**
- ✅ `test_end_to_end_agent_execution` - Full pipeline (acquire → execute → release)
- ✅ `test_timeout_handling_workflow` - Timeout enforcement and cleanup
- ✅ `test_vm_creation_failure_recovery` - Pool recovery from VM creation failures
- ✅ `test_stale_vm_eviction_workflow` - TTL-based eviction
- ✅ `test_pool_acquire_performance` - <100ms acquisition target
- ✅ `test_snapshot_restore_performance` - <1s restore target

**Failing Tests (7):**
- ❌ `test_concurrent_agent_execution` - PooledVM async task coordination
- ❌ `test_snapshot_reset_workflow` - Snapshot manager async mocking
- ❌ `test_error_recovery_workflow` - Complex error recovery with pool refill
- ❌ `test_high_concurrency_execution` - High load (10 agents) workflow
- ❌ `test_mixed_success_and_failure_execution` - Mixed outcomes coordination
- ❌ `test_pool_auto_refill_during_execution` - Background maintenance mocking
- ❌ `test_graceful_shutdown_workflow` - Async task cancellation verification

**Root Cause:** E2E tests mock complex multi-component workflows (pool + executor + snapshot + filesystem). Current mock setup doesn't properly handle:
1. `PooledVM` creation with `created_at` datetime attribute
2. Async task coordination between pool maintenance and test execution
3. Background asyncio tasks (maintenance loop) interfering with test assertions

### Performance Tests (tests/performance/test_benchmarks.py)

**Status:** 8 passing, 7 failing (15 total)
**Coverage:** Performance targets from IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md Phase 5
**File Size:** 780 lines of comprehensive benchmarks

**Passing Tests (8):**
- ✅ `test_vm_boot_time_mvp_target` - <2s boot time (MVP)
- ✅ `test_vm_boot_time_optimized_target` - <500ms boot time (optimized)
- ✅ `test_vm_boot_consistency` - Boot time variance <20%
- ✅ `test_snapshot_create_time` - <2s snapshot creation
- ✅ `test_snapshot_list_time` - <100ms snapshot listing
- ✅ `test_concurrent_execution_performance` - 10 agents in <30s
- ✅ `test_concurrent_with_failures` - Failures don't block throughput
- ✅ `test_executor_throughput` - ≥20 executions/minute

**Failing Tests (7):**
- ❌ `test_pool_acquire_time` - PooledVM mock setup issue
- ❌ `test_pool_acquire_multiple_concurrent` - Concurrent pool acquire mocking
- ❌ `test_pool_refill_performance` - Pool refill timing verification
- ❌ `test_snapshot_restore_time` - Async restore method call
- ❌ `test_concurrent_execution_scaling` - Scaling metrics calculation
- ❌ `test_memory_usage_during_pool_operations` - Memory tracking mock
- ❌ `test_complete_workflow_performance` - End-to-end timing

**Root Cause:** Performance tests require precise timing of async operations. Failures are due to:
1. `PooledVM` creation needs `created_at` attribute in mock setup
2. AsyncMock configuration for pool internals (`_create_fresh_vm`, `_reset_to_golden`)
3. Time measurement interference from mock delays vs. real async execution

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Async Method Mocking

**Problem:** `FilesystemShare` uses async methods (`write_file`, `read_file`, `cleanup`), but initial test setup used synchronous mocks.

**Impact:** 4 integration test failures

**Root Cause:**
```python
# WRONG (current failing tests):
mock_fs.write_file = Mock()  # Not async

# CORRECT (needed fix):
mock_fs.write_file = AsyncMock()  # Properly async
```

**Recommended Fix:**
Update `tests/integration/test_communication.py` lines 94-124 to use `AsyncMock` for all FilesystemShare methods.

### Challenge 2: PooledVM Datetime Attribute

**Problem:** E2E and performance tests create `PooledVM` instances with `created_at` datetime, but mock VMs don't have this attribute.

**Impact:** 7 E2E failures, 7 performance failures

**Root Cause:**
```python
# Tests create PooledVM like this:
pooled_vm = PooledVM(
    vm=mock_vm,
    created_at=datetime.now(nist_et),  # Datetime required
    golden_snapshot="golden-test"
)

# But mock_vm doesn't have created_at attribute
# VMPool code later tries to access: pooled_vm.created_at
# Result: AttributeError
```

**Recommended Fix:**
Add `created_at` attribute to mock VM fixtures in `conftest.py`:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def pooled_vm_fixture() -> PooledVM:
    mock_vm = Mock(spec=VM)
    mock_vm.name = "test-vm"
    mock_vm.uuid = "test-uuid-123"
    return PooledVM(
        vm=mock_vm,
        created_at=datetime.now(ZoneInfo("America/New_York")),
        golden_snapshot="test-golden"
    )
```

### Challenge 3: Background Maintenance Task Interference

**Problem:** VMPool runs background `_maintain_pool()` task that interferes with test assertions.

**Impact:** 3 E2E workflow test failures

**Root Cause:**
Pool maintenance task runs every 10 seconds, creating/destroying VMs. Tests assert exact pool size or VM count, but maintenance task changes these values asynchronously.

**Recommended Fix:**
Mock `asyncio.sleep` in pool maintenance tests to control timing:
```python
async def fast_sleep(seconds):
    if seconds >= 10:  # Maintenance interval
        await asyncio.sleep(0.01)  # Fast forward
    else:
        await asyncio.sleep(seconds)  # Normal sleep

with patch('asyncio.sleep', side_effect=fast_sleep):
    # Test pool operations
```

"""Performance benchmarks for agent-vm system.

This module tests performance targets from IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md Phase 5:
- VM boot time: <2 seconds (MVP), <500ms (optimized)
- Pool acquire time: <100ms (pre-warmed)
- Concurrent execution: 10 agents in <30s
- Snapshot restore: <1 second

All tests use time.perf_counter() for accurate timing measurements.
Tests use mocks by default but can run against real VMs if available.

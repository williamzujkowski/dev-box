# Dependabot Resolution Report

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED

## Summary

All Dependabot security alerts have been resolved by dismissing stale npm dependency alerts. The alerts referenced `package-lock.json` which was removed during the transition to a pure Python project.

## Alerts Dismissed

### Alert #2: @conventional-changelog/git-client (Medium Severity)
- **CVE:** CVE-2025-59433
- **Issue:** Argument Injection vulnerability
- **Status:** Dismissed
- **Reason:** Package no longer in use. The `package-lock.json` file was removed in commit `e6778a9` when transitioning to pure Python project.
- **Resolution Date:** 2025-10-20 21:26:46 UTC

### Alert #1: tmp (Low Severity)
- **CVE:** CVE-2025-54798
- **Issue:** Arbitrary temporary file/directory write via symbolic link
- **Status:** Dismissed
- **Reason:** Package no longer in use. The `package-lock.json` file was removed in commit `e6778a9` when transitioning to pure Python project.
- **Resolution Date:** 2025-10-20 21:26:47 UTC

## Current Security Status

### npm Dependencies
- **Count:** 0 (no npm dependencies remain)
- **Vulnerabilities:** 0

### Python Dependencies (agent-vm project)
**Direct Dependencies:**
- `libvirt-python>=9.0.0` â†’ 11.8.0 âœ…
- `structlog>=24.1.0` â†’ 25.3.0 âœ…
- `prometheus-client>=0.19.0` â†’ (via deps) âœ…
- `pydantic>=2.5.0` â†’ 2.9.2 âœ…
- `asyncio>=3.4.3` â†’ (stdlib) âœ…

**Security Scan Results:**
- **Bandit:** 0 code-level issues (see SECURITY_SCAN_BASELINE.md)
- **Safety:** 5 vulnerabilities in system-wide packages (not agent-vm dependencies)
- **pip check:** No conflicts in agent-vm dependencies âœ…

### System-Wide Python Environment
The `safety check` identified 5 vulnerabilities in packages from OTHER projects in the system-wide Python environment:
- xmltodict 0.14.2 (not used by agent-vm)
- uv 0.7.3 (not used by agent-vm)
- starlette 0.46.2 (not used by agent-vm)
- regex 2024.11.6 (not used by agent-vm)
- 1 additional (not used by agent-vm)

**Impact on agent-vm:** None - these are not dependencies of the agent-vm project.

## Verification

### GitHub Dependabot Status
```bash
$ gh api repos/williamzujkowski/dev-box/dependabot/alerts --jq 'map(select(.state == "open")) | length'
0
```

âœ… Zero open Dependabot alerts

### Agent-VM Dependencies Check
```bash
$ pip list --format=json | jq -r '.[] | select(.name == "agent-vm" or .name == "libvirt-python" or .name == "structlog" or .name == "pydantic")'
agent-vm==0.1.0
libvirt-python==11.8.0
pydantic==2.9.2
structlog==25.3.0
```

âœ… All dependencies installed correctly

## Historical Context

### Why npm Dependencies Were Removed

The dev-box project originated as a mixed Python/Node.js project with documentation tooling (docs/dev-box-site using Eleventy). During the merge to production (commit e6778a9 "Merge kvm_switch to main - Production Ready Release"), the project was simplified to focus exclusively on the Python-based KVM agent isolation system.

**Files removed:**
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- docs/dev-box-site/ (Eleventy-based documentation site)
- All npm-related build tooling

**Rationale:**
- Simplified dependency management (Python-only)
- Reduced attack surface (fewer dependencies)
- Clearer project scope (KVM/Python focus)
- Eliminated npm vulnerability vectors

## Recommendations

### Current (No Action Required)
1. âœ… No open Dependabot alerts
2. âœ… Python dependencies secure and up-to-date
3. âœ… Code-level security verified (Bandit clean)

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. Monitor Dependabot for new Python dependency alerts
2. Run `bandit -r src/` before each release
3. Update dependencies quarterly:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade libvirt-python structlog prometheus-client pydantic
   pytest tests/ --cov
   ```
4. Review SECURITY_SCAN_BASELINE.md quarterly

### Future Security Hardening (Optional)
1. Pin exact dependency versions in pyproject.toml
2. Generate SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) with `syft` or `cyclonedx`
3. Integrate Trivy container scanning in CI/CD
4. Add secret scanning with `detect-secrets` or `gitleaks`

See SECURITY_SCAN_BASELINE.md for detailed security hardening recommendations.

## Conclusion

All Dependabot security alerts have been successfully resolved. The alerts were stale references to npm dependencies that no longer exist in the repository. The current Python-only dependency set is secure with zero known vulnerabilities in direct dependencies.

**Security Status:** ðŸŸ¢ SECURE
**Open Alerts:** 0
**Next Review:** 2026-01-20 (quarterly)
